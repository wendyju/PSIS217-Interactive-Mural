To make the Circuit Playground Express breadboardable: 
* Fan out the wires of a 16P (16 position) ribbon cable
* Cut and strip the wires so that there was just enough to fit through the banana cable holes and wrap around
* Solder the wires on the front and the back
* Put a little hot glue in the middle of the Circuit Playground Express, as strain relief
* Add a 16P IDC connector on the other end of the ribbon cable, making sure the orientation is right
